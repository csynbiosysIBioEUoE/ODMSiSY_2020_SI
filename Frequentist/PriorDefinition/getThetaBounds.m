%% Parameters bounds
% This script extract the parameter bound for PE for all the models and the
% name for the parameters. These bounds ocuppy the same range of values as
% the Bayesian priors for 2 sigma. 

% Inputs:
%       - modl: Integer between 1 and 3 indicating the Toggle Switch model
%       for which the parameter bounds are desired.
